## System Architecture

Indaba Care uses a modern web application architecture with multiple specialized components working together to provide a seamless experience.

![System Architecture Diagram](images/system-architecture.png)

### High-Level Overview

The application follows a client-server model:

- **Client Side (Frontend)**: What users interact with in their web browsers or mobile devices
- **Server Side (Backend)**: The behind-the-scenes components that process data and business logic
- **Databases**: Where all user and application data is stored securely
- **Supporting Services**: Additional components that provide specialized functionality

### How It Works

1. Users access Indaba Care through web browsers or mobile devices
2. The frontend interface communicates with the backend API
3. The API processes requests and interacts with databases and services
4. Results are returned to the frontend and displayed to users
5. Data is synchronized between devices and stored for offline access when needed

This architecture provides:
- Scalability to handle many users simultaneously
- Reliability through redundant components
- Security through isolated services and encryption
- Performance through optimized data access and processing

## Key Components

Indaba Care is built using several specialized technical components, each with a specific role:

### Frontend Application

- **React**: Creates the interactive user interface
- **TanStack Router**: Manages navigation between different pages
- **Tailwind CSS**: Provides consistent styling and appearance
- **Zustand**: Manages application state and data

### Backend Services

- **tRPC API**: Handles data requests between frontend and backend
- **Node.js**: Powers the server-side application logic
- **TypeScript**: Ensures code quality and type safety

### Data Storage

- **PostgreSQL**: Primary database storing all application data
- **Redis**: High-speed cache for frequently accessed information
- **MinIO**: Object storage for files, photos, and videos

### Infrastructure

- **Docker**: Packages the application for consistent deployment
- **Nginx**: Web server that handles incoming connections
- **Authentication Services**: Secures user accounts and data

Each component is containerized using Docker, making the system:
- Easy to deploy across different environments
- Scalable to handle increased usage
- Maintainable with isolated components that can be updated independently

## Data Storage

Indaba Care stores various types of data, carefully organized to maintain relationships between users, children, observations, and other entities.

### Data Model Overview

![Simplified Data Model](images/simplified-data-model.png)

The core entities in our data model include:

- **Users**: Account information for nannies, parents, and administrators
- **Profiles**: Detailed information specific to each user role
- **Children**: Information about children in the system
- **Families**: Groups of parents and children
- **Observations**: Records of children's activities and development
- **Messages**: Communications between users
- **Resources**: Educational materials and content
- **Certifications**: Professional credentials for nannies

### How Data Flows

1. **Creation**: Data is created when users interact with the application
2. **Validation**: All data is checked for accuracy and security
3. **Storage**: Validated data is saved to the appropriate database
4. **Retrieval**: Data is accessed when needed for display or processing
5. **Synchronization**: Changes are synchronized across devices

### Data Protection

- All sensitive data is encrypted in the database
- Personal information is compartmentalized with strict access controls
- Regular backups protect against data loss
- Data retention policies ensure compliance with regulations

## User Interface

The Indaba Care interface is designed to be intuitive and responsive across all devices.

### Responsive Design

The interface automatically adjusts to different screen sizes:
- Desktop computers
- Laptops
- Tablets
- Mobile phones

### Key Interface Elements

- **Dashboard**: Personalized home page showing relevant information
- **Navigation**: Consistent menu system for accessing features
- **Forms**: Structured input areas for adding or editing information
- **Lists and Feeds**: Organized displays of observations, messages, etc.
- **Detail Views**: In-depth displays of specific items
- **Modals**: Popup interfaces for focused tasks

### Accessibility Features

The interface includes features to ensure accessibility for all users:
- Screen reader compatibility
- Keyboard navigation
- Color contrast for readability
- Adjustable text sizing
- Alternative text for images

### Offline Interface

When offline, the interface:
- Clearly indicates offline status
- Shows locally cached data
- Allows creation of new content to be synchronized later
- Provides feedback about pending synchronization

## Offline Capabilities

Indaba Care continues to function even without an internet connection, ensuring caregivers can document observations and access information anywhere.

### How Offline Mode Works

![Offline Sync Process](images/offline-sync-process-technical.png)

1. **Data Caching**: Important information is stored locally on the device
2. **Offline Detection**: The application automatically detects when internet connection is lost
3. **Local Operations**: Changes made while offline are stored in a queue
4. **Background Synchronization**: When connection returns, changes are automatically uploaded
5. **Conflict Resolution**: If conflicts occur (e.g., same data changed in multiple places), they are resolved automatically when possible

### Technical Implementation

The offline functionality uses several technologies:
- **Local Storage**: Securely stores data on the device
- **Sync Queue**: Tracks changes made while offline
- **Service Workers**: Background processes that manage synchronization
- **IndexedDB**: Browser database for storing larger amounts of offline data

### Limitations of Offline Mode

While most features work offline, some limitations exist:
- New resource downloads are unavailable
- Real-time messaging is disabled
- Some media-heavy features may have limited functionality
- Initial login requires an internet connection

## AI Integration

Indaba Care incorporates artificial intelligence to enhance the user experience in several key areas.

### AI-Powered Features

![AI Integration Diagram](images/ai-integration.png)

- **Observation Tagging**: Automatically categorizes observations into developmental domains
- **Content Summarization**: Creates concise summaries of conversations and observations
- **Resource Recommendations**: Suggests relevant educational resources based on child's development
- **Message Assistance**: Helps draft clear, professional messages

### How AI Is Implemented

The AI features use a combination of technologies:
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Understands and processes written text
- **Machine Learning Models**: Recognize patterns and make predictions
- **OpenAI Integration**: Leverages advanced language models for complex tasks
- **On-Device Processing**: Some AI features work even when offline

### Privacy and AI

We prioritize privacy in our AI implementation:
- AI processing occurs securely in isolated environments
- Personal identifiable information is minimized in AI processing
- Users can opt out of AI features if desired
- AI suggestions are always presented as recommendations, not directives

### Fallback Mechanisms

When AI services are unavailable:
- The system uses rule-based alternatives
- Pre-defined templates and categories are offered
- Essential functionality continues without interruption
- Users are notified when AI features are in fallback mode

## Security Measures

Indaba Care implements multiple layers of security to protect user data and ensure privacy.

### Authentication and Access Control

- **Secure Login**: Industry-standard authentication practices
- **Two-Factor Authentication**: Optional additional security layer
- **Role-Based Access**: Users only see information relevant to their role
